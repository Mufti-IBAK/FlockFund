Absolutely, Dr. Mufti — here is a **complete, development-ready product blueprint** for building the **Poultry Investment Cooperative (PIC) Web & Mobile Platform**.

This is the kind of document your dev team needs to **fully understand the system**, its architecture, modules, workflows, user roles, backend logic, automations, and security requirements.

I’ve structured it like a **Technical Product Specification (TPS)** so your developers can start building immediately.

# **POULTRY INVESTMENT COOPERATIVE (PIC) – FULL DIGITAL PLATFORM SPECIFICATION**

### (For Developers, Product Managers & UI/UX Designers)

---

# **3. CORE PLATFORM MODULES**

Below are the essential modules your developers must build.

---

## **3.1 Authentication & Onboarding**

* Email, phone number, or social login
* BVN verification optional (for high-level withdrawals)
* KYC tiers
* Password reset
* Two-factor authentication (optional but recommended)

---

## **3.2 Investment Module**

This is the heart of the system.

Each cycle is represented as a “BATCH”.

### Workflow:

1. Investor selects tier (10, 20, or 30 birds)
2. System computes cost dynamically based on:

   * Current DOC price
   * Current feed price
   * Updated overhead
3. Investor pays
4. System generates:

   * Investment ID
   * MoU PDF
   * Start Date
   * End Date (28 days later)
5. Investor sees countdown + progress bar
6. System auto-calculates expected returns for:

   * Target price (₦10,000)
   * Market Floor (₦8,000)

### Investment statuses:

* **Pending Payment**
* **Active**
* **In Grow-Out**
* **Ready to Sell**
* **Sold**
* **Completed / Payout Ready**
* **Closed**

---

## **3.3 Farm Operations Module**

The platform digitizes the farm for seamless oversight.

### Daily Entry Fields:

* Number of birds alive
* Mortality count
* Feed usage (grams & bag equivalent)
* Medication administered
* Pictures/videos of birds (if included)
* Temperature & humidity (manual entry)
* Notes by manager

**Analytics generated:**

* Mortality %
* Feed conversion ratio (FCR)
* Weekly growth curve
* Veterinary notes summary

---

## **3.4 Veterinary Oversight Module**

* Approve/reject health reports
* Recommend treatments
* Log diseases detected
* Approve final health clearance for sale
* Outbreak flagging system:

  Levels: **Safe → Watch → Alert → Outbreak → Under Control**

If **Alert/Outbreak**, system automatically:

* Notifies all involved investors
* Calculates risk effect
* Triggers veterinary intervention log

---

## **3.5 Sales & Market Module**

Manages the sale of birds at 4 weeks.

Admin decides:

* Sell price (₦10,000 target OR fallback to ₦8,000 floor)
* Quantity sold
* Buyer details
* Transaction confirmation

Once sale is confirmed:

* Admin sets “Batch Sold”
* System computes profit automatically:
  Profit = Revenue – (Cost + PIC Margin)

---

## **3.6 Wallet & Payments System**

### Investor Wallet:

* Balance
* Pending payouts
* Withdrawal requests
* Reinvestment button
* Bank details
* Transaction history

### Features:

* Automatic credit after cycle completion
* Deduction on investment
* Charges imposed automatically
* Admin can bulk pay-out

---

## **3.7 Document System**

Automatically generate downloadable PDFs:

* Signed MoU
* Receipt of investment

---

# **4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

* PostgreSQL or MongoDB
* Redis for caching
* Cloud storage (AWS S3 or Cloudinary)

## **4.2 Frontend**

**Web App:**

# **6. AUTOMATED SYSTEM LOGIC**

## **6.1 Cycle Start Logic**

* Starts once payment is confirmed
* Assigns birds to batch
* Links manager & vet

---

## **6.2 Daily Auto-Checks**

* If no farm update after 24 hours → send reminder
* If mortality > buffer → alert admin + investor
* If feed usage abnormal → vet notified
* If vet fails to approve weekly health → manager blocked from closing cycle
* If cycle reaches Day 28 → auto-notify admin: “Ready to Sell”

---

## **6.3 Profit Computation Logic**

```
TotalRevenue = (BirdsSold * SalePrice)
NetProfit = TotalRevenue - (TotalCost + PICMarginInclusive)
InvestorProfit = NetProfit * InvestorProfitShare
```

**InvestorProfitShare stays fixed based on PIC margin.**

---

## **6.4 Withdrawal Logic**

* Admin approves
* Automated debit from wallet
